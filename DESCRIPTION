Description: The specific_read function extracts a specific 
    read entry from the input BAM file. The cigar_transform 
    function transforms the CIGAR string to be used in the main
    function, alignment_to_ref. Based on the position of the
    alignment to the reference genome and the operations in the
    CIGAR string of the read extracted from the BAM file, the
    alignment_to_ref function shows the alignment of the read 
    to the reference genome.
